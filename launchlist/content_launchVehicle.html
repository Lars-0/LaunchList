It’s now time to select a launch vehicle! If you picked a large spacecraft, you will need to buy a dedicated launch vehicle. If you picked a smaller spacecraft, you have the option to launch rideshare. This means that you launch alongside a larger spacecraft. It’s much cheaper, but you don’t get to control where you go, so the time required to get to your target may be much more.
<br />
<br />

Evaluate the launch vehicles below based upon cost (shown) and the capacity to GTO. Capacity to GTO gives an example of how much power the launch vehicle has. More power means that it takes less time to get to your target. The most capacity to GTO rocket will get your to your target asteroid the fastest.

        <td class="desc_launchVehicle">Geo-transfer orbit is a common orbit for geosynchronous (GSO) satellites to launch into. In geosynchronous orbit, the satellites stay locked to one point on the Earth, so it’s useful for communication and GPS satellites. GTO is an orbit with the apogee (the highest altitude) the same as GSO, but the perigee is lower. Satellites must use propulsion to get to GSO from GTO.
